            <h1>About M Finance</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="write">
            <p> M Finance began as a captive financier of M Finance Utility Vehicles in the early 90s. From
                M Finance
                UVs to tractors to non-M Finance products, the company has diversified into a financial services
                provider
                with a whole suite of financial solutions tailored to the under-served customer in under-penetrated
                rural
                markets.

            <p> Our product portfolio consists of vehicle finance, which includes financing of passenger vehicles,
                utility
                vehicles, tractors, commercial vehicles, construction equipment; and pre-owned vehicles and SME finance,
                which includes project finance, equipment finance, working capital finance and bill discounting services
                to
                SMEs. The company also undertakes mutual fund distribution, fixed deposits and personal loans
                tailor-made to
                suit its unique customer set.
            </p>


            <p>
                With over 24,000 employees, M Finance has a presence in every state in India and a footprint in
                85%
                of its districts. It has a network of over network 1340 offices, serving customers in more than 3,
                80,000
                villages– that’s one in every two villages in the country. And has assets under management (AUM) of over
                Rs.
                81,000 crores.

                Since inception, M Finance has served as a positive change agent catering to the financial needs
                of
                millions in rural and semi-urban India. Its deep connection with the customers and their evolving needs
                has
                been the key to its growth and success. The company has thus pioneered several innovative financial
                solutions tailor-made to the earning patterns of the unique “Earn and Pay” segment that it serves.
            </p>
            Our endeavour to stay deeply connected with the customer begins with our recruitment strategy. We
            consciously recruit employees at the local level, rather than appoint them from cities and depute them
            to
            rural branches.

            Our employees speak the local language, are connected to the land, its people, and understand the local
            challenges. This connect also helps us anticipate market needs and business trends and enables us to
            respond
            with the right combination of products and solutions.
